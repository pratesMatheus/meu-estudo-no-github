Javascript library for managing [Web Access Control](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec) 
permissions.

This is an alternative to the [`acl-check`](https://github.com/solid/acl-check)
library, and is mostly meant for the server-side (to be used in 
[`life-server`](https://github.com/interop-alliance/life-server)).
