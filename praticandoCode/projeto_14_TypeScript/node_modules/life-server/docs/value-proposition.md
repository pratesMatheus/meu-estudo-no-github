## Solid and Life Server Value Proposition for Developers

Features:

* Self-service signup and account management
* Single user mode (for personal use) and multi-user mode (for teams,
  organizations and hosting providers)
* Cross-domain authentication based on a decentralized version of WebID +
  OAuth2/OpenID Connect
* Cross-domain access control (great for collaboration or document sharing
  between different companies or organizations)
* Provides each user with read/write data storage (that is accessible from any
  Javascript and server-side app). Think of it as an Amazon S3 service that is
  simpler to use, has nested folders, and has the option of being self-hosted.

Benefits for creating your web apps with this architecture:

1. A flexible cross-domain authentication and access control system is great for
   social-enabled apps and group collaborations. Also reduces account fatigue /
   password fatigue for users.
1. Data Ownership moves into the hands of your users, which reduces
   compliance risks for data storage.
1. Cross-app data sharing (with users' consent). Enables innovative horizontal
   use cases and apps.
1. "Warm Start" -- your app immediately has access to rich existing user data
   and social graph (great for AI/Machine Learning applications).
1. Offline-first (with synchronization to the user's storage servers) means
   a better user experience (reduced perceived response latency) and the ability
   to function in low-connectivity environments.
1. Integrates with your existing app Javascript development frameworks and tools
   (React, Vue.js, Ember.js, Express, and so on).
